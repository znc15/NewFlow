# FlowPilot - Usage Guide

[中文](usage-guide.md)

## What Is This

A 99KB single-file tool that turns Claude Code into a fully automated development machine.
Copy one file into your project, describe one requirement, and it will automatically decompose requirements, assign tasks, write code, commit to git, run tests, until everything is done.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- One supported client installed: `Claude Code`, `Codex`, `Cursor`, `snow-cli`, or another client that can follow the generated instruction file
- Enable parallel / auto-run according to the client:
  - `Claude Code`: add `"env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" }` to `~/.claude/settings.json`
  - `Codex`: add to `~/.codex/config.toml`
    ```toml
    [features]
    multi_agent = true
    ```
    For unattended execution, prefer `codex --yolo`
  - `Cursor`: enable `Agents` in settings and set `Auto-Run Mode` to `Run Everything`
  - `Other clients`: self-test multi-agent / auto-run behavior first
- **Plugins / skills recommended** (skipping only degrades capability):
  - Claude Code can install `superpowers`, `frontend-design`, `feature-dev`, `code-review`, `context7` via `/plugin`
  - Codex / Cursor can use the one-click installer package documented at the end

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Copy flow.js to Your Project

```bash
cp /path/to/workflow-engine/dist/flow.js  your-project-directory/
```

### Step 2: Initialize

```bash
cd your-project-directory
node flow.js init
```

This auto-generates:
- It first shows client options, then generates according to the selected client:
  - `CLAUDE.md` — default instruction file in `Claude Code` mode (legacy projects remain compatible)
  - `AGENTS.md` — default instruction file in `Codex / Cursor / Other` mode
  - `ROLE.md` — additionally generated only for `snow-cli`, with the same content as `AGENTS.md`
  - `.claude/settings.json` — generated only for `Claude Code`
- `status / next / finish / review / init` also adopt a friendlier terminal style with stronger grouping, status markers, next-step hints, and richer live status cards
- `.workflow/` directory — local transient runtime state
- local-state `.gitignore` rules when missing — by default `.workflow/`, `.flowpilot/`, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/worktrees/`
- These output-style upgrades are **presentation-layer only**: they do not change workflow scheduling, protocol priority, command syntax, checkpoint rules, or state-machine semantics

### Step 3: Describe Your Requirements

Open a CC window and directly describe what you want to build:

```
Build a blog system with user registration/login, article publishing, and comments
```

CC will automatically:
1. Check for unfinished workflows (if found, resume from breakpoint)
2. If none → decompose your requirements and start fully automated execution

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Project from Scratch

```
You: Build a blog system with user registration/login, article publishing, and comments
CC: (Auto-decomposes into 10+ tasks, executes in dependency order)
```

### Scenario 2: Incremental Development on Existing Project

```bash
cd existing-project
node flow.js init    # Take over project
# Open CC, describe development requirements
You: Add a search feature to the existing system
```

### Scenario 3: Interruption Recovery

Computer shut down, CC crashed, context full — no problem:

```
# Open a new CC window
You: Continue task
CC: Resuming workflow: Blog System | Progress: 7/12 | Pending task-owned changes detected for interrupted task 008; scheduling paused
```

Client guidance:
- `Claude Code`: prefer `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue`
- `Codex`: re-enter the project directory, run `codex --yolo`, then say "continue task"
- `Cursor`: reopen the project and continue in the existing chat or a new one
- `snow-cli` / other clients: reopen the project, restore or start a new session, then say "continue task"

If the worktree still has unarchived changes, `resume` also reports the real boundary state instead of using a generic success message:
- baseline unarchived changes that existed before the workflow and are still present
- explicitly owned task changes that are safe to adopt as task residue
- ownership-ambiguous additions made during the workflow window, which may include manual user edits/deletions and will not be auto-restored by FlowPilot
- a conservative warning when the dirty baseline is missing and FlowPilot can no longer prove this is a clean restart or distinguish user changes from task residue
- when pending worktree changes exist, the workflow enters `reconciling` and requires `adopt`, or restart only after handling the listed task-owned changes

## Command Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `node flow.js init` | Initialize/take over project |
| `node flow.js init --force` | Force re-initialize (overwrite existing workflow) |
| `node flow.js status` | View current progress |
| `node flow.js next` | Get next task (with dependency context) |
| `node flow.js next --batch` | Get all dependency-parallel tasks suitable for batch dispatch |
| `node flow.js checkpoint <id>` | Mark task complete (stdin/--file/inline) [--files f1 f2 ...] |
| `node flow.js adopt <id>` | Adopt pending task-owned changes and record a checkpoint |
| `node flow.js restart <id>` | Allow a task to restart after the listed task-owned changes are handled; ownership-ambiguous files require manual review |
| `node flow.js skip <id>` | Skip a task |
| `node flow.js resume` | Interruption recovery (enters reconciling when needed) |
| `node flow.js review` | Mark code-review as done (required before finish) |
| `node flow.js finish` | Smart finalization (run auto verification and print the final task summary; the workflow does not end until review is done and the final commit succeeds) |
| `node flow.js add <desc> [--type T]` | Add new task (argument order flexible) |
| `node flow.js recall <keyword>` | Search historical memories (BM25 + MMR + temporal decay) |
| `node flow.js evolve` | Accept AI reflection results and apply evolution (stdin) |

> Note: During normal use you don't need to run these commands manually — CC calls them automatically per protocol.

### What `status` Shows Now

`node flow.js status` is no longer just a flat list of task ids. It aims to surface the user's real question first:

```text
**Current Status**
Done 2/4 | 1 active | 1 blocked

**Task Progress**
[x] 001 Fix entrypoint
[>] 002 Implementing | updated 8s ago | running tests
[!] 003 Blocked | waiting for manual confirmation
[ ] 004 Pending

**Next**
- Resolve the blocker in 003
- Then continue finish
```

When sub-agents continuously report their stage, FlowPilot can also show:
- `Analyzing / Implementing / Verifying / Blocked`
- last activity time
- a short recent progress note
- heartbeat-based stuck warnings

### What `finish` Does Now

`node flow.js finish` now has a clearer shutdown order:

1. Run automatic verification first  
   It prefers `verify.commands` from `.flowpilot/config.json` / `.workflow/config.json`; if the current directory has no detectable scripts but contains exactly one recognizable child project, FlowPilot automatically descends into that child project and verifies there. `vitest` is normalized to `--run` to avoid watch-mode hangs.
2. Print the final workflow summary  
   The terminal output includes the full task list with `[x] / [-] / [!] / [ ]` markers for done, skipped, failed, and incomplete tasks.
3. Write `.workflow/final-summary.md` before deleting `.workflow/`  
   This preserves the "summarize first, clear later" ordering and leaves a summary file in place until cleanup actually happens.
4. Only after `review` is complete and the final commit actually succeeds does FlowPilot clean up and return to idle

If verification fails, `finish` aborts finalization and asks you to fix the issue first. Even after verification passes, FlowPilot keeps the workflow alive until `review` is done and the final commit truly succeeds; if the final commit is skipped or degraded, `.workflow/` is preserved and the next step is explained explicitly.

## Task Input Format

`node flow.js init` receives a task list via stdin:

```markdown
# Blog System

Full-stack blog application

1. [backend] Database design
   PostgreSQL + Prisma, users/articles/comments tables
2. [backend] API routes (deps: 1)
   RESTful API, CRUD endpoints
3. [frontend] Homepage (deps: 2)
   Article list, pagination
4. [general] Deployment config (deps: 2,3)
   Docker + nginx configuration
```

Format rules:
- `[type]` — frontend / backend / general
- `(deps: id)` — Dependent prerequisite tasks (optional)
- Indented lines — Task description (optional)

## Generated File Structure

```

## How It Works

```
User describes development requirements
    ↓
The client reads the instruction file (`CLAUDE.md` by default for Claude Code, `AGENTS.md` for Codex / Cursor / Other, legacy repos keep their existing file) → Finds embedded protocol → Enters dispatch mode
    ↓
flow resume → Check for unfinished workflow
    ↓
flow next --batch → Return all dependency-parallel tasks + dependency context
    ↓
CC dispatches sub-agents in parallel via Task tool (Agent Teams)
    ↓
Sub-agents checkpoint themselves → Record output + auto git commit
    ↓
Main agent confirms progress → Loop until all complete
    ↓
code-review → flow review → Unlock finish
    ↓
flow finish → Auto run build/test/lint → Report completed/skipped/failed → Clean .workflow/ → Final commit
    ↓
Return to standby, await next requirement
```

## Agent Teams Parallel Development In-Depth

This is FlowPilot's most powerful capability. Understanding the parallel mechanism can double your development efficiency.

### How Parallel Works

```
Main Agent (dispatcher)
  │
  ├── flow next --batch
  │   Returns all tasks with satisfied dependencies (e.g. 3)
  │
  ├── Dispatch 3 sub-agents simultaneously (one message, 3 Task tool calls)
  │   ├── Sub-Agent-A → Execute task 001 → Self-checkpoint
  │   ├── Sub-Agent-B → Execute task 002 → Self-checkpoint
  │   └── Sub-Agent-C → Execute task 003 → Self-checkpoint
  │
  └── After all 3 sub-agents return
      Main agent runs flow status to confirm → Continue next round
```

Key points:
- Main agent prefers `flow next --batch` to get all dependency-parallel tasks at once; if write boundaries are still unclear, `flow next` can be used temporarily for manual serialization
- Dispatches in parallel via multiple Task tool calls **in a single message**
- Each sub-agent **works independently, checkpoints independently, commits independently**
- Main agent context doesn't bloat from sub-agent output (sub-agents record their own)

### Designing Task Dependencies to Maximize Parallelism

Core principle: **Tasks without dependency relationships are automatically executed in parallel.**

Bad design (fully sequential, one after another):
```markdown
1. [backend] Database design
2. [backend] User API (deps: 1)
3. [backend] Article API (deps: 2)      ← Doesn't actually depend on User API
4. [frontend] User page (deps: 3)       ← Actually only depends on User API
5. [frontend] Article page (deps: 4)    ← Actually only depends on Article API
```

Good design (fully parallel):
```markdown
1. [backend] Database design
2. [backend] User API (deps: 1)
3. [backend] Article API (deps: 1)       ← Only depends on DB, parallel with 2
4. [frontend] User page (deps: 2)        ← Only depends on User API
5. [frontend] Article page (deps: 3)     ← Only depends on Article API, parallel with 4
6. [general] Integration tests (deps: 4,5)
```

Timeline comparison:
```
Bad design:  1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5          (5 rounds)
Good design: 1 → [2,3] → [4,5] → 6      (4 rounds, tasks 2&3 parallel, 4&5 parallel)
```

### Real-World Example: E-Commerce System

```markdown
# E-Commerce Platform

Full-stack e-commerce application

1. [backend] Database design
   PostgreSQL: users, products, orders, payments, cart
2. [backend] Auth module (deps: 1)
   JWT + bcrypt, register/login/refresh token
3. [backend] Product API (deps: 1)
   CRUD + paginated search + image upload
4. [backend] Order API (deps: 1)
   Order/payment/refund flow
5. [frontend] Shared component library
   Header/Footer/Card/Modal/Form components
6. [frontend] Product list page (deps: 3,5)
   Product cards, filters, pagination
7. [frontend] Cart page (deps: 3,5)
   CRUD, quantity adjustment
8. [frontend] Login/register page (deps: 2,5)
   Form validation, error messages
9. [frontend] Order page (deps: 4,8)
   Order flow, order history
10. [general] E2E tests (deps: 6,7,8,9)
    Playwright core flow tests
```

Execution timeline:
```
Round 1: [1, 5]           ← Database and frontend component library in parallel
Round 2: [2, 3, 4]        ← Three API modules in parallel
Round 3: [6, 7, 8]        ← Three frontend pages in parallel
Round 4: [9]              ← Order page (depends on login and order API)
Round 5: [10]             ← E2E tests
```

10 tasks in only 5 rounds — sequential would take 10.

### Parallel Interruption and Recovery

If interrupted during parallel execution (CC crash, compact, close window), all running sub-agent tasks remain in `active` state.

Recovery flow:
```
New window → Say: continue task → flow resume
  ↓
Detect 3 active tasks → Reset all to pending
  ↓
flow next --batch → Re-dispatch all 3 tasks in parallel (when write boundaries are clear)
```

`flow resume` resets **all** active tasks to pending, regardless of count. This means after a parallel interruption, that entire batch is redone. Already checkpointed tasks are unaffected.

At the same time, resume now reports the dirty-worktree state truthfully:
- `Current worktree has no pending task-owned changes; this resume is a clean restart`
- `N unarchived changes from before workflow start are still preserved`
- `Preserved N explicitly owned task changes that can be adopted as residue`
- `Found N workflow-period additions with ambiguous ownership (may include manual user edits/deletions; FlowPilot will not auto-restore these files)`
- `Dirty baseline missing; cannot reliably distinguish pre-existing changes, interrupted-task residue, and manual user edits/deletions`

These lines are boundary diagnostics, not errors. Their job is to prevent a dirty worktree from being mislabeled as perfectly clean.

### Parallel Development Notes

1. **File conflicts**: Parallel sub-agents may modify the same file. Design tasks so parallel tasks operate on different files
2. **When in doubt, add dependencies**: If unsure whether two tasks are dependent, adding the dependency is safer. Incorrect parallelism is more dangerous than sequential execution
3. **Right-sized tasks**: Too large = low parallel benefit, too small = high dispatch overhead. Each task should correspond to one independent module or feature

## Supported Project Types

During finalization, `flow finish` auto-detects and runs verification:

| Project Type | Detection File | Commands |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | package.json | Whatever scripts exist among build/test/lint, in order; in this repo that means `npm run build` and `npm run test` |
| Rust | Cargo.toml | cargo build/test |
| Go | go.mod | go build/test |
| Python | pyproject.toml | pytest/ruff/mypy |
| Java (Maven) | pom.xml | mvn compile/test |
| Java (Gradle) | build.gradle | gradle build |
| C/C++ | CMakeLists.txt | cmake --build/ctest |
| Generic | Makefile | make build/test/lint |

Verification results are intentionally explicit:
- **passed**: the command ran successfully, for example `- Passed: npm run build`
- **skipped**: the command ran but confirmed there was nothing to do, such as Vitest reporting `No test files found`
- **not found**: the repository has no runnable verification commands at all, so finish prints `Verification result: no runnable verification commands found`

In other words, finish does not blur together “no command exists” and “a command failed.”

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` | Yes | Set to `1` to enable Agent Teams (configure in `env` section of `~/.claude/settings.json`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | Anthropic API Key, enables LLM smart extraction and deep reflection analysis |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | No | Alternative to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (use either one) |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | No | Custom API endpoint, defaults to `https://api.anthropic.com` |

Configuration (in `~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-...",
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.anthropic.com"
  }
}
```

> Without an API Key, memory extraction and evolution reflection both fall back to pure rule engine mode. Core functionality is unaffected.

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if Agent Teams isn't enabled?**
The protocol will instruct CC to stop immediately and prompt you to enable it. Add `"env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" }` to `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**Q: What if context fills up?**
After CC auto-compacts, just say "continue task" to resume. All state is in files, independent of conversation history.

**Q: What if a task fails?**
Auto-retry 3 times. If still failing after 3, it's skipped and the next task continues. Finish reports all skipped and failed tasks.

**Q: Can I add requirements mid-way?**
Yes. Just tell CC the new requirement and it will run `flow add` to append a task. Argument order is flexible: `flow add search feature --type frontend` or `flow add --type frontend search feature` both work.

**Q: What if I don't want a certain plugin?**
Plugins are optional. Without the frontend-design plugin, frontend tasks execute in general mode.

**Q: Why did `flow finish` refuse the final commit?**
The most common causes are:
1. newly dirty files that were never owned by any checkpoint `--files` declaration
2. leftover user changes in the instruction file (`AGENTS.md`, or legacy `CLAUDE.md`), `.claude/settings.json`, or `.gitignore` after cleanup
3. a missing dirty baseline, so FlowPilot can no longer prove the workflow boundary is safe

When this happens, FlowPilot stays in `finishing` state and lists the suspicious files instead of committing on your behalf. As long as the final commit has not truly succeeded, the workflow is not cleared. In instruction files / `.claude/settings.json` / `.gitignore`, these leftovers should be interpreted as user-owned or baseline edits first: FlowPilot will not auto-restore that content, and those manual edits must not be treated as disposable workflow residue.

**Q: Should .workflow be committed to git?**
Usually no. `.workflow/` is local transient runtime state, `flow finish` removes it on successful completion, and the default `.gitignore` policy ignores it.

**Q: How are `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.gitignore` cleaned up?**
They follow ownership-based symmetric cleanup:
- if FlowPilot created them during setup/init and the contents still exactly match the injected content, finish deletes them or restores them precisely
- if they already existed, finish removes only the FlowPilot-owned injected portion and keeps your original content
- the FlowPilot-owned `.gitignore` rules cover `.workflow/`, `.flowpilot/`, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/worktrees/`, but do not ignore the entire `.claude/` directory
- if user residue still remains after cleanup, finish refuses the final commit and names the file; those changes are treated as user-owned and must be resolved manually rather than auto-restored

**Q: Will summaries get too long with many tasks?**
No. After 10+ completed tasks, summaries auto-compress by type, keeping only the 3 most recent task names per group.

## Optional: One-Click Skill Installation for Codex / Cursor

> This is an optional enhancement. FlowPilot itself works without these installers; skipping them only degrades some Skills / MCP capabilities.

The repository includes bundled installers compatible with both `Codex CLI` and `Cursor`:

- Root folder: [`兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/`](/work2026/tools/FlowPilot/兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能)
- Codex package: [`兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/codex一键安装技能/`](/work2026/tools/FlowPilot/兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/codex一键安装技能)
- Cursor package: [`兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/cursor一键安装技能/`](/work2026/tools/FlowPilot/兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/cursor一键安装技能)

How to choose:
- For `Codex CLI` skills / MCP, use `codex一键安装技能/`
- For `Cursor` skills / MCP, use `cursor一键安装技能/`

Common entry points:

```bash
# Codex (macOS / Linux)
cd "兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/codex一键安装技能"
chmod +x install.sh repair.sh
./install.sh --force

# Cursor (macOS / Linux)
cd "兼容codex@cursor一键安装技能/cursor一键安装技能"
chmod +x install_cursor_skills.sh repair_cursor_skills.sh self_check_cursor_skills.sh
./install_cursor_skills.sh
```

On Windows, use the bundled `.bat` / `.ps1` launchers in each package directory.

After installation:
- restart `Codex CLI` for Codex
- restart `Cursor` for Cursor
- if you only want the main FlowPilot workflow, you can skip this step entirely

## Uninstalling FlowPilot

If you no longer want FlowPilot in a project, remove the files it copied in or generated at runtime:

- `flow.js` (the single-file tool you copied into the project)
- the instruction file:
  - usually `CLAUDE.md` in `Claude Code` mode
  - usually `AGENTS.md` in `Codex / Cursor / Other` mode
  - the existing instruction file is reused for legacy-compatible setups
  - `ROLE.md` as well in `snow-cli` mode
- `.claude/settings.json` (if FlowPilot generated it in `Claude Code` mode)
- `.workflow/` (local transient runtime state)
- `.flowpilot/` (local persistent state)

Typical cleanup:

```bash
rm -rf flow.js AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md ROLE.md .claude/settings.json .workflow .flowpilot
```

Notes:
- If you manually added long-term project guidance into `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `ROLE.md`, keep what you need before deleting them
- If deleting `settings.json` leaves `.claude/` empty, you can remove the directory too
- If you only want to disable the workflow but keep the instruction file, you can remove just `flow.js`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.workflow/`, and `.flowpilot/`

## Long-Term Memory System

FlowPilot includes a cross-workflow persistent memory system that lets AI accumulate project knowledge across multiple development rounds, avoiding repeated mistakes.

### Knowledge Tags

Sub-agents can tag key information during checkpoint. Tagged content is automatically extracted and permanently saved:

| Tag | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `[REMEMBER]` | Facts, discoveries, solutions worth remembering | `[REMEMBER] Project uses PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM` |
| `[DECISION]` | Technical decisions and rationale | `[DECISION] Chose JWT over sessions for stateless auth` |
| `[ARCHITECTURE]` | Architecture patterns, data flows | `[ARCHITECTURE] Three-layer: Controller → Service → Repository` |

Checkpoint example:
```bash
echo 'Completed auth module [REMEMBER] passwords use bcrypt [DECISION] chose JWT auth' | node flow.js checkpoint 001 --files src/auth.ts
```

### Knowledge Extraction Paths

Memory extraction supports dual paths, automatically selecting the optimal approach:

| Path | Condition | Capability |
|------|-----------|------------|
| LLM Smart Extraction | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present | Two-phase Extract→Decide: first extracts key facts, then deduplicates against existing memories (ADD/UPDATE/SKIP) |
| Rule Engine | No API Key or LLM call fails | Tagged line extraction + decision pattern matching (CN/EN) + tech stack/config detection |

Both paths process `[REMEMBER]`/`[DECISION]`/`[ARCHITECTURE]` tags. The LLM path additionally extracts implicit knowledge from natural language.

### Search Engine

Memory queries use three-source fusion retrieval:

1. **BM25 Sparse Search** — Multilingual tokenization (CJK forward maximum matching + Latin stemming) + BM25 cosine similarity + temporal decay
2. **BM25 Vector Search** — FNV-1a 20-bit sparse vector index, cosine similarity top-k
3. **Dense Embedding Search** — Calls embedding API for dense vectors (requires API Key)

Results from all three sources are fused via **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)**, then reranked with **MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)** to balance relevance and diversity.

Temporal decay: `score = exp(-ln2/halfLife * ageDays)`, half-life 30 days. Entries sourced from `architecture`/`decision`/`identity` never decay (evergreen).

### recall Command

Manually search historical memories:

```bash
node flow.js recall "database design"
node flow.js recall "authentication strategy"
```

Returns the top 5 most relevant memories, sorted by fused score. During normal workflows, the `next` command automatically queries related memories and injects them into task context — no manual recall needed.

## Self-Evolution System

FlowPilot includes a three-phase self-evolution cycle, inspired by [Memoh-v2](https://github.com/Kxiandaoyan/Memoh-v2)'s organic evolution architecture. Automatically reflects and optimizes after each workflow round — no manual trigger needed. **Both successful and failed workflows trigger evolution** — successes distill best practices, failures analyze root causes and adjust strategies.

### Three-Phase Cycle

**Phase 1: Reflect** — Auto-triggered at end of `finish()`

Analyzes the current workflow's success/failure patterns:
- Consecutive failure chain detection (≥2 consecutive failed tasks)
- Type failure concentration (>30% fail rate for a type)
- Retry hotspots (tasks with >2 retries)
- High skip rate (>20%)

Uses Claude Haiku for deep analysis when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available, falls back to rule engine otherwise.

**Phase 2: Experiment** — Auto-triggered at end of `finish()`

Auto-adjusts based on reflect report:
- **Config params**: `maxRetries`, `timeout`, `verifyTimeout`
- **Protocol template**: Appends experience rules to protocol.md

Full snapshot saved before each modification for rollback support.

**Phase 3: Review** — Auto-triggered at start of `init()`

Validates previous experiment results:
- Compares failRate, skipRate, retryRate between last two workflow rounds
- Any metric worsened by >10 percentage points → auto-rollback to pre-experiment snapshot
- Checks config.json validity and protocol.md integrity

### Complete Evolution Loop

Evolution isn't a standalone step — it's a complete closed loop embedded in the finalization process:

```
finish(verify) → review(code-review) → evolve → finish(verify again)
```

Detailed flow:
1. `flow finish` — runs verification and prints each step as passed or skipped under `Verification result:`
2. On pass, prompts for code-review → `flow review` marks it done
3. `flow finish` again → checks the dirty baseline and owned-file boundary, then attempts the final commit; only a real final commit success can proceed to cleanup, reflect + experiment, and idle
4. If verification fails, or if unowned dirty files / leftover user changes remain in setup-owned files, or if the final commit is skipped / degraded, finish refuses to end the workflow; fix the issue and run finish again until verify + review + ownership boundary + final commit all pass

### Evolution Result Consumption

Parameters adjusted during the Experiment phase take effect in the next workflow round:

| Parameter | Description | Adjustment Scenario |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `maxRetries` | Max task retry count | Increased when retry hotspots are frequent, decreased when all succeed |
| `hints` | Experience rules appended to protocol template | Specific advice distilled from failure patterns |
| `verifyTimeout` | Verification timeout | Increased when verification times out |

### evolve Command

Manually trigger evolution (normally called automatically by the protocol):

```bash
echo 'reflection result JSON' | node flow.js evolve
```

Accepts AI reflection results (JSON format) and executes the Experiment phase parameter adjustments. During normal workflows, `finish` triggers this automatically — no manual execution needed.

### Graceful Degradation

| Environment | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY present | LLM deep analysis + rule engine dual path |
| No API Key | Pure rule engine (failure chains/type concentration/retry hotspots/skip rate) |
| API call fails | Silent fallback to rule engine, workflow uninterrupted |
| No history data | All checks pass, no rollback |
